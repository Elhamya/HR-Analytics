Predicting Employee Churn in R

Employee retention is a critical factor in organisational success. High turnover not only disrupts team morale but also creates significant costs compared to retaining current employees. Fortunately, data-driven strategies can help organisations identify risks early and take effective action.

In this project, I explore how HR data can be leveraged to improve retention by:

Collecting and combining data from multiple HR sources

Performing feature engineering and exploratory analysis

Building and validating a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition

Estimating the ROI of a potential retention strategy

This end-to-end workflow demonstrates how data analytics can directly support strategic HR decision-making.
